# Problems in my React App
--> Responsive: Navigation bar needs a fix so that it turns into a button. I plan to fix this error soon! 
--> Error: I have noticed that when you try to + or - the numbers are not updated in the shopping cart in the Navigation bar. I plan to fix this error soon! 
--> I have also noticed the loading time is longer than usual: Large Photos are making it slow will look into this in near future.


# Conclusion
--> This being my first project I have used an older project to help me through the shopping cart. I found this project extremely challenging and yet very satisfying, I get the big picture now about 'React components'
--> Here I have used the old school class base components as I wanted to start from the basic
--> I am going to make a new e-commerce project right after this one, I plan to use React hooks and redux!
