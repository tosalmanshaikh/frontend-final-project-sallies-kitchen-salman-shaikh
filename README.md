# Welcome to my 'Sallies' Kitchen App' 
In this app you are able to make an account log in/log out. You can virtually shop or look for a recipe in the search engine.

What do I need to use this app?
- Clean working computer or a modern laptop 
- An IDE such as webstorm to run this application
- Project link: `https://github.com/tosalmanshaikh/frontend-final-project-sallies-kitchen-salman-shaikh` - you can directly clone this to your IDE or zip it and open it and run it!

What do I need to install in my terminal?
- Run `npm i` in your terminal to install all the dependencies: More info about Install Node.js and NPM @ `https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npm-install`
- Run `react-hook-form` in your terminal
- Run `npm i react-router-dom@5.1.2`in your terminal: we are using the old version as in the newer version things are a bit different 'Routing' wise!
- Run `npm i axios` in your terminal
- Run `npm start` to run the project

![](src/images/ReadMeImages/LogIn.jpg)

- You can either log in | register here
- I have used Novi backend for my project. The input field is responsive so nothing can go wrong here as the placeholder will tell you as you go 
- Once you have made an account, now you can log in with your details, only you are able to see your personal details, you will notice that the button is now switched to log-out, this simply would mean that you are logged in!

# Problems in my React App
- Responsive: Navigation bar needs a fix so that it turns into a button/modal. I plan to fix this error soon!


# Conclusion
- This being my first project I have used an older project to help me through the shopping cart. I found this project extremely challenging and yet very satisfying, I get the big picture now about 'React components'
- Here I have used the old school class base components as I wanted to start from the basic
- I am going to make a new e-commerce project right after this one, I plan to use React hooks and redux!
