# Shop
--> You can directly click on the Add to cart button and the shopping cart will open directly
--> Notice that the item in the cart is now changed to 'already in the cart'
--> You can also click on the photo for a detailed description. you can add this to the cart here alternatively or go back to the products. If you click and nothing happens means your item is already in the cart. 
--> You can add the items in the cart or decrease the items as you wish 
--> You can delete the item as well by clicking on the icon on the right 
--> You can open the cart by clicking on the shopping cart and simply close it with the 'x' close button

--> When you do this you can click on the ingredients alternatively you can click on the link for more details


# Account
--> You can either log in | register here

--> Once you have made an account, now you can log in with your details, only you are able to see your personal details, you will notice that the button is now switched to log-out, this simply would mean that you are logged in!
--> You can choose Home | Shop or simply log out if you wish


# Problems in my React App
12. Responsive: Navigation bar needs a fix so that it turns into a button. I plan to fix this error soon! 
13. Error: I have noticed that when you try to + or - the numbers are not updated in the shopping cart in the Navigation bar. I plan to fix this error soon! 


# I have also noticed the loading time is longer than usual
--> I have looked into this and the reason behind was the large photos, which I deleted right away as I wasn't using them, the ones that I have are large sized photos - I will look into this soon! 
--> I also replaced the social logos as this was also making it slow
--> I had a few errors in the console log, they are all fixed now!  


# Conclusion
--> This being my first project I have used an older project to help me through the shopping cart. I found this project extremely challenging and yet very satisfying, I get the big picture now about 'React components'
--> Here I have used the old school class base components as I wanted to start from the basic
--> I am going to make a new e-commerce project right after this one, I plan to use React hooks and redux!
