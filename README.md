# Getting Started with my React App

Welcome to my 'Sallies' Kitchen App'. The best things in life are simple and so is my App! - :D 

Steps to follow:
1. Run `npm i` in your terminal to install all the dependencies  
2. Run `npm start` to run the project 

3. Home page: gives you some information about the bakery
4. Footer: Register | Log in, Active links to Social media. You have to click one the first one! :) --> ("Dedicated to Nova")
5. About: simple, you also have active links here that will bring you to the shop or to the account

6. Shop: 
--> you can directly click on the Add to cart button and the shopping cart will open directly
--> Notice that the item in the cart is now changed to 'already in the cart'
--> You can also click on the photo for a detailed description. you can add this to the cart here alternatively or go back to the products. If you click and nothing happens means your item is already in the cart. 
--> You can add the items in the cart or decrease the items as you wish 
--> You can delete the item as well by clicking on the icon on the right 
--> You can open the cart by clicking on the shopping cart and simply close it with the 'x' close button
--> You can click on the payment if you like and that will bring you to a simple form. Once you fill this in you can click on 'Place your order'
--> Your order has been placed you can now either choose to click Home | Shop 

7. Contact, FAQ, Gallery, Careers, Blogs - very simple, but a quick stroll will do
8. Languages: I will be working on this in near future

9. Search:
--> Here you can search for food recipes
--> Just type any food item in the search-bar
--> When you do this you can click on the ingredients alternatively you can click on the link for more details

10. Account: 
--> You can either log in | register here
--> I have used Novi backend for my project. The input field is responsive so nothing can go wrong here as the placeholder will tell you as you go 
--> Once you have made an account, now you can log in with your details, only you are able to see your personal details, you will notice that the button is now switched to log-out, this simply would mean that you are logged in!
--> You can choose Home | Shop or simply log out if you wish


# Problems my React App
12. Responsive: Everything is working fine except for the Navigation bar which needs a fix, so it works on smaller screens. I plan to fix this error soon! 
13. Errors: I have noticed that when you try to + or - the numbers are not updated in the shopping cart in the Navigation bar. I plan to fix this error soon! 

14. I have also noticed the loading is longer than usual: 
--> I have looked into this and the reason behind was the large photos, which I deleted right away the ones that I have are large sized photos - I will look into this soon! 
--> I also replaced the social logos as this was also making it slow
--> I had a few errors in the console log, they are all fixed now!  


# Conclusion
15. 
--> This being my first project I have used an older project to help me through the shopping cart. I found this project very challenging and yet very satisfying, I get the big picture now about 'React components'
--> Here I have used the old school class base components as I wanted to start from the basic
--> I am going to make a new e-commerce project right after this one, I plan to use React hooks and redux!
